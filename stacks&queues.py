#Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater
# element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1

#Solution using stack:
"""
So to find next greater element, we used stack one from left and one from right.simply we are checking which element is greater and storing
 their index at specified position. The following algo and the code is for the prev greater elem
1- if stack is empty, push current index.
2- if stack is not empty
a)if current element is greater than top element then store the index of current element on index of top element.
Take the following eg and dryrun the below code on this, everything will be clear
eg. for array [2, 25, 20, 11, 21, 3]
stack A -> emtpy

		if stack != []:# even after popping if something is in stack then it is the match we were looking for
			left_list[i] = stack[-1]# so got the ans
		if stack == []:# this means stack has got empty while popping all elems in the while loop, so nothing in the left anymore
			left_list[i] = 0# so no elem on the left of the current index satisfies the condition

#Given an array of integers A of size N. A represents a histogram i.e A[i] denotes height of
#the ith histogramâ€™s bar. Width of each bar is 1.
""" Solution: To find the maximal rectangle, if for every bar x, we know the first smaller bar on its each side, let's say l and r,
we are certain that height[x] * (r - l - 1) is the best shot we can get by using height of bar x. OK, let's assume we can do this in
O(1) time for each bar, then we can solve this problem in O(n)! by scanning each bar. use an increasing stack can keep track of the
first smaller on its left and right. for stack[x], stack[x-1] is the first smaller on its left, then a new element that can pop stack[x]
out is the first smaller on its right."""
